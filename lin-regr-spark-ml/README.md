For this lab we will use a dataset called million songs. You can read up more on it here.
While you are developing your ML pipeline, we recommend that you use the tiny version
of the dataset which is 1.2MB big from this link. The full 200 GB dataset and a 1.9 GB
subset of it are available as public datasets on www.hops.site.


All spark logs are going into the spark.log.
